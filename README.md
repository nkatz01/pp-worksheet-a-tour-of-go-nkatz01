# Worksheet - A Tour of Go

For this worksheet you should follow one of the Google `Go` tutorials - "A Tour of Go".

An interactive introduction to Go in three sections. 

+ The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; 
+ the second discusses methods and interfaces; and 
+ the third introduces Go's concurrency primitives. 

Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. 
You can take the [tour online][online] or install it locally with:

```
$ go get golang.org/x/tour
```

This will place the `tour` binary in your workspace's `bin` directory (by default a `go` directory in the root of your home directory).
